# Guy-Lab

Certainly! Here is a more detailed version of the text:

This repository is a collaborative space for code sharing between students who are being guided by Professor Guy Shani. It is intended to be a place where students can share their code and learn from one another as they work on various projects and assignments.

If you have code that you would like to contribute to the shared repository, you are welcome to do so! Simply follow the guidelines for contributing outlined in the repository's README file. This usually involves forking the repository, creating a new branch for your changes, committing your changes to the branch, pushing the branch to your fork, and submitting a pull request to the main repository.

By contributing to this shared repository, you can help your fellow students learn from your code and potentially improve their own projects and assignments. We encourage all students to take advantage of this opportunity to collaborate and learn from one another.
